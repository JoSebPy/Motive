# Motive
Motive is a web application to help BINUS Students to find skilled associates or help colleagues to develop projects while still attending college.

The application is similar to crowdfunding sites. But, rather than building projects by fundings, a project is developed through finishing work needed to build that product collectively by capable/skilled applicants of their major field accordingly, hired/chosen by the project starter, with or without rewards offered.


This application is a group project, developed by :
- Andrian Syah
- Arvin Melvillo
- Daniel
- Jonathan Sebastian Prayoga
- Nicholas Dominic

I worked on this project as the main backend developer, designing the logic and writing the code mainly for the features of the application and some of the database structure with PHP and JS.
